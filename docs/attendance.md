# Attendance policy

This unit has an attendance and engagement hurdle as well as an exam. This page explains the attendance policy and hurdle. The short version: _turn up to all mandatory workshops, and engage with your group and the material._

## Background

This unit prepares you, among other things, for the second-year unit COMS20006 Software Engineering project, where you will work in groups to develop a piece of software. One of the programme-level learning outcomes which that unit covers is

> O4. The ability to work as a member of a development team, recognising the different roles within a team and different ways of organising teams.

The first step towards that outcome is turning up on time to all group meetings (unless seriously unwell), and engaging with the group and the material during the meeting.

## Expectations

For this unit, we expect you to:
  - Prepare for each workshop by watching videos and reading articles as indicated.
  - Attend all mandatory workshops. You should aim to not have more than one unexcused absence for the whole unit.
  - In case of illness or other good reason (job interview, funeral etc.), use the self-certification or extenuating circumstances forms, and provide evidence where appropriate.
  - Have a working camera and microphone, and turn them both on if a TA asks you to do this or if you are supposed to work in a group with other students.
  - Engage in the tasks set during the individual sessions.

Some students will have legitimate reasons for adjustments to these rules across the entire term, such as registered disabilities, or caring responsibilities. As long as you let the university know in advance, it is not a problem to make exceptions in these cases - speak to your personal tutor or a senior tutor if this applies to you.

There is an attendance hurdle on this unit as follows: to be awarded credit for the unit you must pass the exam and be signed in to at least 75% of mandatory workshops. This is formally specified on the [unit catalogue page](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=20%2F21&unitCode=COMS10012).

## How attendance is recorded

The attendance hurdle is below the level of attendance that we would expect a properly engaged student to show: you should aim to attend _all_ mandatory workshops. If you are unwell or absent for other good reason and let the university know via the official forms, the workshop counts as attended for credit purposes.

Attendance on this unit is taken by TAs. You must arrive on time and join your assigned group on Teams; if a TA asks you a question, turn your microphone and camera on and reply to it. TAs will only sign you in if you engage when they talk to you: it is not enough to be logged in but with your microphone and camera off, even if you are working on the unit.

In many sessions, TAs will ask you (or the whole group) questions about the unit and you must attempt to answer as part of getting signed in. You do not need to get the answer right - you are not being assessed on your knowledge until you get to the final exam. But the TAs are checking that you are participating in the unit, and giving you an opportunity to check and get feedback on your progress.

You can ask the TAs at any time during a session whether you are signed in yet, or which previous sessions you have been signed in for.

If you are late to a session, it is your responsibility to actively seek out a TA, explain your reason for being late and ask them to sign you in.

Attending the labs means getting your attendance taken by a TA during the lab hour, and engaging with the exercises means showing your work or discussing your answers with the TA if they ask you. _You must have a working microphone and camera for this unit, and you must turn both of them on if a TA asks you to._ If you are unable for good reason (such as illness) to attend a lab, then you should submit a [self certification for absence form](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/current-students/student-systems/) - use the link _Engineering Student Forms_ on that page.
